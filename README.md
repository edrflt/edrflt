# Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am a 26 years old software engineer at Hopserve.  
Student from 42 Paris, I worked on a x86 kernel in rust (on which I keep working sometimes) and security projects.  
Former engineering intern at Thales SIX, freelance developer, VLC iOS contributor at Videolabs.

I started developing at the age of 10 and have become more and more passionate about this over time.  
Currently, I like to work with Rust, Swift, and various scripting languages, on the area of cybersecurity.
